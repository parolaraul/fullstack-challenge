# Booking system for B2B (Travel Agencies)
## App Description
SPA used by travel agencies to book and manage flight/hotel/car/train tickets. It is user based, profiled, multi-tenant and allows connection to different tickets providers.

## TechStack 
Using **Node.JS** for the backend microservices and **AngularJS** (+14) for the frontendsI collaborated in the development of new features and bug-fixing. The application is divided into dockerized microservices, hosted on **AWS**. The provider uses SOAP for message exchange.

## My Contribution
- I successfully developed and deployed to production an integration with the main train tickets provider. 
- I created a new microservice using NestJS, its tests and pipeline configurations for CI/CD and the UI/UX related with the train ticket's sale and post-sale flows. 
- I was responsible for the communication with the provider, the API design, development, testing and the deployment into production. All flows were certified by the provider in order to go live.
